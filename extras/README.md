# Understanding
This level will be used to retrieve all the latest images as it will be constantly being
updated as newer updates of the system images gets received.

The `images.json` file is being used to fetch all available system images that can be
downloaded. You can provide on runtime a custom `images.json` file by running this following
command:

```shell
# If using JAR
java -jar android-sysimg-downloader.jar --custom [location/to/images.json]

# If using Java-built Runtime Binaries (generated by JPackage)
android-sysimg-downloader --custom [location/to/images.json]
```

---

The `compatibility.json` file will be used to check, if a current build is eligible for
the use of `images.json` file. This will be firstly checked in order for the JSON Formatting.
If Formatting fails during the runtime, it will most likely crash.
